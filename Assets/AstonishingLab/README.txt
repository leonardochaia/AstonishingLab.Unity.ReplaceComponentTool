How to use
 Simply right click any component in the Inspector and click the "Replace Component with sub-type".
 Then, choose a sub-type from the window and the component you right-clicked on will be replaced
 with a new instance of the sub-type you've selected. This instance will have all properties of the 
 parent class copied.
